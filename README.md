GridSenpAI

AI-powered translation between data center electrical design and grid interconnection modeling

GridSenpAI is an artificial intelligence platform designed to bridge the information gap between large load customers (LLCs) such as hyperscale data centers and transmission planners (TPs) responsible for grid reliability studies.

Modern data centers are highly complex electrical systems composed of UPS systems, generators, power electronics, and control systems. Transmission planners must evaluate the grid impacts of these facilities, but the information provided during interconnection applications is often incomplete or difficult to translate into power system simulation parameters.

GridSenpAI solves this problem by automatically translating facility electrical design information into model-ready parameters that can be used directly in transmission planning tools.

Problem

Large load interconnection requests are rapidly increasing due to growth in:

• Hyperscale data centers
• AI compute clusters
• Electrified industrial loads

Transmission planners must determine how these loads will behave during:

• grid disturbances
• voltage events
• frequency events
• switching operations

However, planners often lack detailed information about how the facility’s internal electrical systems will respond to these events.

As a result:

• planners make conservative assumptions
• modeling uncertainty increases
• study timelines increase
• interconnection queues grow

GridSenpAI addresses this modeling translation gap.

Solution

GridSenpAI uses AI-assisted engineering translation to convert facility design information into structured parameters suitable for power system simulation tools.

The system ingests information such as:

• single line electrical diagrams
• generator specifications
• UPS topology and control behavior
• facility load architecture
• electrical protection schemes

Using document intelligence and retrieval augmented reasoning, GridSenpAI converts this information into modeling inputs used by planners.

Outputs include parameters compatible with tools such as:

• PSS/E
• PSLF
• PowerWorld

Parameter Translation Concept

GridSenpAI converts facility electrical design parameters into grid modeling parameters.

Example mapping:

Facility Input	Translation Logic	Transmission Planner Parameter
UPS topology	infer load control behavior	ZIP load coefficients
Generator model	determine dynamic response	dynamic generator model
Load distribution	aggregate behavior	composite load model
Power electronics	identify fast response behavior	inverter-based resource model

This translation layer enables planners to model large facilities more accurately.
